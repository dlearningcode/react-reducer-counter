# Counter App

- React useReducer Practice Project

In Meta's Front End Developer Certificate program offered by Coursera, in the React Basics course they had just a brief overview of the useReducer function, so I asked Bing to give me a practice project to help me understand and implement the reducer function better. This is what it gave me.

## Project Name

Counter App

## Project Description

Create a simple counter application that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset the counter value. The counter value should be stored in the reducer function.

## Project Requirements

âœ… Create a new React application using create-react-app.

- Implement a CounterReducer using the reducer function.

- Create a CounterProvider component that wraps the entire application.

- Implement buttons that increment, decrement, and reset the counter value.

- Update the CounterProvider component to apply the updated counter value to all components in the application.
